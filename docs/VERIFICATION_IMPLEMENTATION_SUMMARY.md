# User Verification System Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive user verification system for your Rixdu application that handles both individual and business owner verification according to your requirements.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**File: `backend/models/User.js`**

- Added `documentVerification` field to User schema
- Includes verification status, type, documents, contact number, and timestamps
- Added helper methods: `isDocumentVerified()` and `canSubmitVerification()`

### 2. Verification Controller

**File: `backend/controllers/verification.controller.js`**

- `submitVerification` - Submit verification documents (individuals/business)
- `getVerificationStatus` - Get current verification status
- `getPendingVerifications` - Admin: Get all pending verifications
- `reviewVerification` - Admin: Approve/reject verifications
- `getVerificationDetails` - Admin: Get detailed verification info

### 3. API Routes

**File: `backend/routes/verification.routes.js`**

- `POST /api/v1/verification/submit` - Submit verification
- `GET /api/v1/verification/status` - Get status
- `GET /api/v1/verification/pending` - Admin: Get pending (with pagination)
- `PUT /api/v1/verification/review/:userId` - Admin: Review verification
- `GET /api/v1/verification/details/:userId` - Admin: Get details

### 4. File Upload Middleware

**File: `backend/middleware/verification-upload.middleware.js`**

- Handles multipart form data for document uploads
- Validates file types (images only)
- File size limits (10MB per file, max 4 files)
- Proper error handling for upload issues

### 5. Validation Utilities

**File: `backend/utils/verificationValidation.js`**

- UAE phone number validation and formatting
- Emirates ID format validation and formatting
- Business license validation
- File type and size validation

### 6. Updated User Management

**File: `backend/controllers/user.controller.js`**

- Added `getUserVerificationStats` for admin dashboard
- Updated user listings to include verification status

## Verification Requirements Implemented

### Individual Verification

✅ **UAE Contact Number**: Validated and formatted (+971XXXXXXXXX)
✅ **Valid Emirates ID**: Format validation (784-YYYY-XXXXXXX-X)

- Requires front and back images
- ID number validation and formatting

### Business Owner Verification

✅ **Emirates ID**: Same as individual verification
✅ **UAE Contact Number**: Same as individual verification  
✅ **Valid Business License**:

- Business license image upload
- License number validation
- Business name requirement

## API Endpoints Summary

### User Endpoints

- **Submit Verification**: `POST /api/v1/verification/submit`
- **Get Status**: `GET /api/v1/verification/status`

### Admin Endpoints

- **Pending Verifications**: `GET /api/v1/verification/pending`
- **Review Verification**: `PUT /api/v1/verification/review/:userId`
- **Verification Details**: `GET /api/v1/verification/details/:userId`
- **Verification Stats**: `GET /api/v1/users/verification-stats`

## Verification Status Flow

1. **unverified** → User hasn't submitted documents
2. **pending** → Documents submitted, awaiting admin review
3. **verified** → Admin approved the documents
4. **rejected** → Admin rejected with reason (can resubmit)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `backend/controllers/verification.controller.js`
- `backend/routes/verification.routes.js`
- `backend/middleware/verification-upload.middleware.js`
- `backend/utils/verificationValidation.js`
- `backend/docs/VERIFICATION_API.md`
- `backend/docs/VERIFICATION_FRONTEND_EXAMPLES.js`

### Modified Files

- `backend/models/User.js` - Added verification schema
- `backend/server.js` - Added verification routes
- `backend/controllers/user.controller.js` - Added verification stats
- `backend/routes/user.routes.js` - Added stats endpoint

## Security Features

- **File Upload Security**:

  - Only image files allowed
  - File size limits (10MB per file)
  - Files uploaded to Cloudinary with organized folders

- **Data Validation**:

  - UAE phone number format validation
  - Emirates ID format validation
  - Business license validation

- **Access Control**:
  - User routes protected with authentication
  - Admin routes protected with role-based authorization

## Next Steps for Frontend Implementation

1. **Create Verification Form Components**:

   - Individual verification form
   - Business verification form
   - File upload components with preview

2. **Create Admin Dashboard Components**:

   - Pending verifications list
   - Verification review interface
   - Verification statistics dashboard

3. **Integration Points**:

   - Use the provided frontend examples in `VERIFICATION_FRONTEND_EXAMPLES.js`
   - Implement proper error handling and user feedback
   - Add loading states for file uploads

4. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Progress indicators during upload
   - Image preview before upload
   - Clear error messages and validation feedback
   - Status tracking for submitted verifications

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are configured in your `.env` file:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

The verification system is now fully functional and ready for frontend integration. The API documentation and examples provided will help the frontend team implement the user interface components.
